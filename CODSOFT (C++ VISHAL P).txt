    NUMBER GUESSING GAME
  

    create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it . provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number

SIMPLE CALCULATOR 



   develop a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition , subraction ,multiplication, and division .allow the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform
